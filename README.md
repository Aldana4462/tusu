# La CÃ¡psula Interactive Artwork

This project is a small interactive demo built entirely with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It displays nine floating "capsules" over a dark animated background with subtle particles.

Features:
- Radial gradient background that "breathes" with a pulsing glow.
- Twenty particles moving in smooth sinusoidal loops for a sense of depth.
- Nine numbered capsules styled with gradients and shadows to appear glassy.
- Hovering over a capsule shows a tooltip with its details.
- A modal purchase form allows users to claim a capsule and leave a message and optional URL.
- Responsive layout with no external dependencies.
